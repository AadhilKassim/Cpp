# Starting a New Journey 
### Complete C++ Beginner to Professional

## Day1
Installed and configured C++ compilers in VSCode. Configured Intellisense and complied the course's first program. Created functions in program. 

## Day2
Refreshed on the topic Number Systems. Created program to store and display these numbers. 
Explored inegral(int) modifiers and found out its sizes and uses.
Tried out sizeof operator, different initialisations, and floating number types. 

## Day3
Carried out different arithmetic operations and tried out boolean and auto datatypes. Uses of assingment operator were tried out and understood.

## Day4
Today is sunday and I feel lazy. Todays lectures were longer than usual. Understood and applied use of Prefix and Post fix methods of increment and decrement. Worked on relational operators and moved onto logical operators. Tried combining both relational and logical operators. Next topic is text formating in terminal, which I watched but will try it out tomorrow.

## Day5
Tried out Cmath library available in C++. Next part of todays lecture was if, if else, else if, switch, and ternary operator. 

## Day6
For today main topic was loops. Tried out for, while, and do while loops. Next part deals with arrays. How to print data from arrays and how to get data into array using loops. Character arrays and C-string relation along with how to print them.

## Day7
Tried out pointers, how they work. Pointers to char and what are ther uses. 

## Day8
Todays lectures were continuation of pointer. How dynamic allocation of memory works, what are new and delete operators, and tried out different ways of allocation and deallocation. Next part is dangling pointers. What happens to programs on operating on pointers. Moved on to Failure of new operator, how to check for it. Although its rare. Last lecture was on nullpointer safety. 

## Day9
Todays lecture was on dynamin array allocation and the differences between stack array and heap array. Next was references. What are references, how they can be used (same as the original variable), and its uses were discussed.

## Day10
Tried out string in C++, will go into more detail some other day. Next is functions of C++. Tried out some basic format of creating functions.
